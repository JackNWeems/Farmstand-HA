# Farmstand-HA

## The problem
Plants need food, water, and light to grow. A farmstand (https://www.lettucegrow.com) is a great way to provide all of those but it requires turning a pump and lights on and off at the proper time as well as adding food and water weekly. We could use simple timers to control things as well as setting up a routine where we check the water weekly, but where is the fun in that.

## The solution
Get a relay board (https://www.esphome-devices.com/devices/ESP-12F-Relay-X4) and write some firmware to control thew pump and lights, as well as add a button to indicate that nutrients have been added. In addition to controlling everything locally get all of this information reporting to Home Assistant.
